![video](https://i.ibb.co/MfvkZbv/ezgif-com-gif-maker-3.gif)

# How Does It Work
This Project was made in [Batch  Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) and [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

It provides a way to **create graphical interfaces** using simple **Batch Script** code.

**Runtime Process**
* Batch Script creates an [HTML Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application) using [HTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
* Javascript **send responses** directly to **Batch**

# Limitations
* You can only use **pure javascript**, since this is not running on any browser, **web functions** and css events **are not available**
